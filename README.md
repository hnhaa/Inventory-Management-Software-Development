# Inventory Management System Software Development 💾
This project aims to design and implement a Python-based inventory management system for a pizza restaurant, incorporating seamless integration with MySQL for efficient inventory tracking and order management.

## ⚙️ Build Steps
- Designed **sequence diagram** to illustrate the flow of the system and system requirements.
- Created user-friendly GUI using **tkinter library** in
Python for efficient inventory management.
- Implemented **CRUD functions** to manage inventory
items and data control.
- Integrated system with MySQL database for data
storage and retrieval.
- Blueprinted intuitive user interface for interaction
and inventory management using Python language.
- Carried out thorough testing of modules to verify
functionality and interoperability.

## 🎞️ Demo & Snippets
### 1. Inventory Management System Interface
To build the interface, there are 4 Python files to work on:
- Create an [Inventory database](https://github.com/hnhaa/Inventory-Management-Software-Development/blob/main/Inventory.sql) on MySQL
- Define [Inventory class](https://github.com/hnhaa/Inventory-Management-Software-Development/blob/main/Inventory.py)
- Define [Inventory Repository class](https://github.com/hnhaa/Inventory-Management-Software-Development/blob/main/InventoryRepository.py) (connected to MySQL)
- Define [Inventory Controller class](https://github.com/hnhaa/Inventory-Management-Software-Development/blob/main/InventoryController.py)
- Define [Inventory UI](https://github.com/hnhaa/Inventory-Management-Software-Development/blob/main/InventoryUI.py)

Below is the interface of the inventory management system.

### 2. CRUD Functions
The interface offers 4 main CRUD functions: Create (Add), Update, Read (Search) and Delete.
