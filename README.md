# Inventory Management System Software Development üíæ
This project aims to design and implement a Python-based inventory management system for a pizza restaurant, incorporating seamless integration with MySQL for efficient inventory tracking and order management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Steps
- Designed sequence diagram to illustrate the flow of the system and system requirements.
- Created user-friendly GUI using tkinter library in
Python for efficient inventory management.
- Implemented CRUD functions to manage inventory
items and data control.
- Integrated system with MySQL database for data
storage and retrieval.
- Blueprinted intuitive user interface for interaction
and inventory management using Python language.
- Carried out thorough testing of modules to verify
functionality and interoperability.

## üéûÔ∏è Demo & Snippets
### 1. Inventory Management System Interface
To build the interface, there are 4 Python files to work on:
- Create a database on MySQL
- Define Inventory class
- Define Inventory Repository class (connected to MySQL)
- Define Inventory Controller class
- Define Inventory UI

Below is the interface of the inventory management system.
